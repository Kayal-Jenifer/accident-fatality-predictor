    <h2>Welcome to the KSI Prediction Project!</h2>
    <p>
        Every year, traffic accidents result in tragic losses and serious injuries (KSI - Killed or Seriously Injured).
        Understanding the factors that contribute to the severity of an accident is crucial for developing effective
        road safety measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this project, we analyzed a dataset of traffic collisions to build a machine learning model capable of
        predicting whether an accident is likely to be Fatal or Non-Fatal based on various contributing factors.

    <h2>Choosing the Right Tool: Model Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
        We explored several machine learning algorithms to find the most accurate predictor. Here's a summary of
        how different models performed on our test data:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Model</th>
                <th>Accuracy</th>
                <th>Precision</th>
                <th>Recall</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            {% for name, metrics in evaluations.items() %}
            <tr class="{{ 'best-model-row' if name == best_model else '' }}">
                <td>{{ name }}</td>
                <td>{{ metrics.Accuracy }}</td>
                <td>{{ metrics.Precision }}</td>
                <td>{{ metrics.Recall }}</td>
            </tr>
            {% endfor %}
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="highlight">
        Based on these results, the <strong>{{ best_model }}</strong> model demonstrated the highest accuracy and a good balance
        of precision and recall. Therefore, we selected it for our prediction tool.
